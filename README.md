# Texturize Me C'apn v1.0

**Written By**: Joseph Bourque (aka StaticHex, aka SlashDotVirus)

### How To Use

This is very new software, so new it's not actually complete yet. This might be interesting from an image processing perspective though and so for now all this really does is crunch a color texture into greyscale pixel art. 

1. Change the following lines in `main.py` to your desired input/output image to use. 
```python
input = "./inputs/soil2.jpg"
output= "./outputs/soil2.jpg"
```
2. Run the program and click "generate image"
